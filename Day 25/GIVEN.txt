A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given a number,n, determine and print whether it is Prime or Not prime.

Note: If possible, try to come up with a O(sqrt(n)) primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an O(n) algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code.
