A coworker has prepared functions that will perform the tests and validate return values. Finish the implementation of 3 classes to provide data and expected results for the tests.

Complete the following methods.

In the class TestDataEmptyArray:

	-get_array() returns an empty array
In the class TestDataUniqueValues:

	-get_array() returns an array of size at least 2 with all unique elements
	-get_expected_result() returns the expected minimum value index for this array
In the class TestDataExactlyTwoDifferentMinimums:

	-get_array() returns an array where the minimum value occurs at exactly 2 indices
	-get_expected_result() returns the expected index
Take a look at the code template to see the exact implementation of functions that your colleague already implemented.

Note: The arrays are indexed from 0.
